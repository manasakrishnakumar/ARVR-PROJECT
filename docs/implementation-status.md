# Implementation status

## Phase 1 — Environment and architecture
- [x] Environment inspected: Python 3.10.11, Git 2.55, Docker present; Node.js 24.22.1 / npm 11.19.1 installed via winget during this session; Unity not found.
- [x] Repo structure (backend, docs, scripts, datasets, artifacts)
- [x] FastAPI app, config, SQLite schema (users, sessions, repetitions)
- [x] Exercise library as JSON (5 exercises, illustrative targets)
- [x] Endpoints: GET /api/health, /api/exercises, /api/exercises/{id}, POST/GET /api/sessions, GET /api/sessions/{id}
- [x] 3 API tests pass (pytest)
- [ ] Frontend (Vite+React+TS) — blocked: Node.js not installed
- [ ] docs/architecture.md, installation.md (README covers backend only so far)

## Phase 3 - Exercise analysis (done, synthetic-data tests only)
- [x] Repetition counter state machine (rest/moving_out/target/returning, hysteresis, min duration, gap abort)
- [x] Per-repetition features, rule-based assessment (acceptable, insufficient_range, incomplete_repetition, too_fast, uncontrolled, insufficient_data)
- [x] POST /api/assessment/evaluate (angle series in, repetitions and assessments out)
- [x] 22 backend tests pass; fixed AngleSmoother permanently rejecting persistent jumps
- [x] Live wiring: WebSocket /api/ws/analysis (StreamAnalyzer) <-> Pose lab session UI: exercise + manual difficulty select, rep counter vs target, phase chip, progress bar, once-per-rep feedback, optional audio, rep table, pose-lost warning. 25 backend tests pass; verified in browser with synthetic demo (3/5 reps counted, all 'acceptable').
- [ ] Real webcam path and non-elbow exercises NOT yet tested live (demo only animates elbow flexion); thresholds illustrative; no real human recordings yet
- [ ] Sessions are not persisted yet (Phase 5/6); difficulty is manual until the adaptive controller exists

## Later phases: not started
Pose estimation, angles, repetition counter, assessment, ML, adaptation, dashboard, AR, 3D, evaluation.
